// Solution:
/*
 Here's an algorithm to find the Kth smallest element in a row-wise and column-wise sorted 2D array:

 **Algorithm:**

 1. **Min-Heap:** Create a Min-Heap (priority queue with minimum element at the top).
 2. **Initialize Heap:**
     - Iterate through the first row of the matrix and add each element along with its corresponding row and column indices to the Min-Heap.
 3. **Loop for K elements:**
     - Run a loop **K** times:
         - Extract the minimum element (**min_element**) from the Min-Heap. This is the current Kth smallest element seen so far.
         - Get the row and column indices of **min_element**.
         - If **K == 1** (reached the Kth element), return **min_element**.
         - Add the next element from the same column (element at `row_index + 1, column_index`) to the Min-Heap if it exists (i.e., not exceeding the matrix bounds).
         - Re-arrange the Min-Heap using the `min-heapify` operation to maintain the min element at the top.

 **Explanation:**

 - The Min-Heap prioritizes smaller elements. By iterating through the first row (smallest elements in each column) and adding them to the heap, we get a starting point for finding the Kth smallest element.
 - In each iteration, we extract the minimum element from the heap (current Kth smallest) and replace it with the next element from the same column (potentially smaller element) if it exists.
 - Re-arranging the heap ensures the smallest element remains on top after each replacement.

 **Time Complexity:**

 - Creating the initial heap with `n` elements takes O(n * log(n)) time due to heap insertions.
 - The loop iterates `K` times, and each iteration involves extracting the minimum (log(n)) and potentially adding a new element (log(n)) along with heap re-arrangement (log(n)). This results in O(K * log(n)) time complexity.
 - Overall time complexity: O(n * log(n) + K * log(n)) â‰ˆ O(n * log(n)) for large `n`.

 **Space Complexity:**

 - The Min-Heap uses O(n) space to store elements.

 **Example:**

 Consider the input matrix:

 ```
 10, 20, 30, 40
 15, 25, 35, 45
 24, 29, 37, 48
 32, 33, 39, 50
 ```

 For K=3:

 1. Min-Heap: {10 (row 0, col 0)}
 2. Extract min: 10, K becomes 2.
 3. Add next element from same column (15). Min-Heap: {15 (row 1, col 0), 20 (row 0, col 1)}
 4. Extract min: 15, K becomes 1.
 5. Add next element (20). However, we stop here as K becomes 1 (reached the 3rd smallest element).

 The output is 20.
